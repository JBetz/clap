# clap

Haskell bindings for the [CLAP](https://cleveraudio.org/) audio plugin API.

`Clap.Interface.Foreign.*` has low-level C ABI bindings generated by [c2hsc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/c2hsc) using [bindings-DSL](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-DSL).

`Clap.Interface.*` provides idiomatic Haskell types and functions for using the CLAP interface.

`Clap.*` has higher-level functions for building a CLAP host.
